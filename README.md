# Global Temperature Trends Analysis

## Description
A comprehensive app analyzing global temperature trends from 1743-2013, using Python for data processing and visualization to understand climate changes and regional differences.

## Project Overview
The Global Temperature Trends Analysis project aims to explore and understand the changes in average temperatures worldwide over a period of 270 years. The project utilizes advanced data processing and analysis techniques to uncover long-term climate trends, identify anomalies, and compare regional temperature changes. The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from Kaggle, ensuring a broad and reliable range of data.

## Goals
- **Understanding Temperature Trends:** Analyze long-term trends in global temperature changes.
- **Identifying Anomalies:** Detect years that deviate from overall trends, indicating potential extreme climatic events.
- **Regional Comparisons:** Compare temperature changes across different regions of the world.
- **Climate Change Conclusions:** Draw conclusions about global warming and its impact on Earth's climate.

## Techniques and Tools Used
- **Python:** Programming language used for data processing and analysis.
- **Python Libraries:** Utilization of pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for visualization.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Applying statistical methods for data analysis to interpret the results.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Contains the dataset `GlobalLandTemperaturesByMajorCity.csv`.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks containing the analysis and visualizations.
- **README.md**: Documentation of the project.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
